# WYSIWYG-Editor

A WYSIWYG is an editor that allows a developer to preview the end results before the actual interface or document is made live. The full form of WYSIWYG is “what you see is what you get”. This type of software allows you to edit content in a form so that it looks same when displayed or printed.
